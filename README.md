# Walmart_analysis_SQL
This repository contains the Walmart sales dataset, which has been analyzed using MySQL. Pretty basic project to analyze but the insights are worthy.  

- Designed and implemented a Walmart sales database with detailed attributes for customer type, product lines, payment methods, and revenue metrics.
- Performed feature engineering by adding time-based columns (e.g., time of day, day of the week, month) to enhance sales analysis.
- Conducted data analysis to answer business-specific queries, such as identifying unique cities, most popular payment methods, and top-selling product lines.
- Analyzed sales performance by time of day and weekdays, identifying peak sales periods and customer purchasing behaviors.
- Generated revenue insights by city and branch, identifying high-performing locations and branches exceeding the average product sales.
- Evaluated customer demographics, including gender distribution and customer types, to understand purchasing patterns and revenue contribution.
- Implemented queries to identify the most frequent customers, top revenue-generating customer types, and gender distribution across branches.
- Performed VAT (tax) analysis to identify cities and customer types contributing the most to tax revenue.
